# lambda-ci
AWS Lambda CI/CD Pipeline

Automated Deployment of code to Lambda. All changes get kicked off thru the pipeline outlined in the Lambda docs:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/automating-deployment.html

When code changes fail, you must make a new change to kick off the build again.
